## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first project created with React. I was able to put into practice what I have learned in React so far, for example the following React Hooks:

- useState
- useEffect
- useReducer

### Continued development

My next steps will be to learn the advanced concept of React.
